      <description>The OK Center for Contemporary Art commissioned 5 Hörstationen (Listening Posts) for their 2015 Exhibtion Das Geheimnis der Vögel. The idea was to deliver facts about birds in a playful way to the 100.000 exhibtion visitors. Wooden Boxes, evoking a bird house theme were placed in the exhibition area. A woodpecker sound, played back by a speaker inside the box, would alert passer-bys about the possibility to interact and invite them to inspect the sound source.</description>

      <description>Shopping Mill is an interactive, multi-sensory installation: a treadmill augmented with display and headphones. Walking on the mill simulates a shopping experience with Muzak playback and an endlessly unfolding, 3D-generated shopping aisle. Shopping Mill is a meditation on the relationship between de-realized labor and senseless consumption. A trip into the military entertainment complex. Muzak – the company – was founded by a highly decorated war veteran. Its product was not only developed to make people feel comfortable in uncomfortable architectures but also to heighten attentiveness and productivity in the work place.</description>
