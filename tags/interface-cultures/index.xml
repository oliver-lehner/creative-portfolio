      <description>&lt;p&gt;The factory as a metaphor for productivity is the main theme of this folder and the simplistic Blender rendering I created also defined the color palette for the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Aw yiss, Neon Pantone Colors! I thought up a three-dimnensional post-post-horn and used its wireframe representation as an eye-catcher. We also recreated the graphic with neon-orange gaffa tape as a larger-than-life tape graffiti in the exhibtion space. I had fun designing this one and it shows!

      <description>Military and police in numerous countries around the globe use Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs) as weapons against agitated crowds. LRADs emit a focused sound beam with an intensity that is high enough to permanently damage human hearing. Because it is not desirable for a governmental entity to use weapons, even the non-lethal type, against its own citizens, the manufacturer markets these sonic weapons as “hailing device,” a device that facilitates communication between the authorities and the mob.</description>

      <title>Shopping Mill</title>

      <description>Shopping Mill is an interactive, multi-sensory installation: a treadmill augmented with display and headphones. Walking on the mill simulates a shopping experience with Muzak playback and an endlessly unfolding, 3D-generated shopping aisle. Shopping Mill is a meditation on the relationship between de-realized labor and senseless consumption. A trip into the military entertainment complex. Muzak – the company – was founded by a highly decorated war veteran. Its product was not only developed to make people feel comfortable in uncomfortable architectures but also to heighten attentiveness and productivity in the work place.</description>
