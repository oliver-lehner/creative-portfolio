As part of my artistic research of documentation and conservation of sound 
installations based on consumer VR technology I found it important to investigate
gallery soundscapes. With help from Sennheiser Austria and Ars Electronica Festival 
I recorded ambisonic audio at the festival site and prepared a Web VR Experience to make 
ephemeral sound art felt after its physical manifestation ceased to exist.
