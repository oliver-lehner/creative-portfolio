I contributed a small VR part to Sam Bunn's spectacular utopian Performance/Installation ["Through the Far-see-er"](https://www.ufg.at/Through-the-Far-See-Er.14936+M5e01d77daae.0.html). It is available [here](https://far-see-er-vr.firebaseapp.com) but recent changes to motion sensor API could mean your mobile device will not be able to display it correctly. (At the time of this writing, it worked on Firefox v67.0 for Android).
