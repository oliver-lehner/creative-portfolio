The OK Center for Contemporary Art commissioned 5 _Hörstationen_ (Listening Posts) for their 2015 Exhibtion _Das Geheimnis der Vögel._ The idea was to deliver facts about birds in a playful way to the 100.000 exhibtion visitors. Wooden Boxes, evoking a bird house theme were placed in the exhibition area. A woodpecker sound, played back by a speaker inside the box, would alert passer-bys about the  possibility to interact and invite them to inspect the sound source. As visitors approached the _Hörstation,_ it would trigger playback of factoids related to the theme of the exhibition.
