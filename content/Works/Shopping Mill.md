Shopping Mill is an interactive, multi-sensory installation: a treadmill augmented with display and 
headphones. Walking on the mill simulates a shopping experience with Muzak playback and an 
endlessly unfolding, 3D-generated shopping aisle. 
Shopping Mill is a meditation on the relationship between de-realized labor and senseless consumption. 
A trip into the military entertainment complex. Muzak – the company – was founded by a highly 
decorated war veteran. Its product was not only developed to make people feel comfortable in 
uncomfortable architectures but also to heighten attentiveness and productivity in the work place. 
Is it the music that keeps you going or is it the other way around?
